This is my D&D style game. It is based off of D&D obviously, but it is not a direct copy from anything just what I imagine to be D&D. There's a village with a blacksmith and armorsmith shops. There is also the chief who starts you off with points and starts you on your adventure. There is almost certainly bugs in this game, but it is still finishable.
It is pretty self explanatory, but you start in a forest a little bit away from a village that you have to get to by using the move command. You can see where you and the village are by using the map command. When you actually get to the village you have to visit the chief first then you can buy gear at the armorsmith and blacksmith. You can actually go on your adventure by going back to the chief. Then he explains to you what your task will be and then you can start your adventure. There is a "narrator" character that basically guides you through your adventure and has the power to stop time. 
You have to have the imports really only matplotlib is the only one whoever grading this might not have, but it is really easy to get as long as you have python which I really hope you do. Ignore the other files and just look at main.py it's the only important one.
